## Dental Screening Mobile App

### Mobile application for dental screening
Poor oral health contributes 4.5% to the total health care cost (Mainly tooth decay, gum disease and tooth loss) affects many Australian children and adults. 
Unfortunately, many people in Western Australia are unable to readily access oral health care services due to a combination of remote living areas, a lack of available and qualified workforce, and fear of clinical dental procedures. These factors exacerbate the severity of not only dental health outcomes, but associated general health outcomes like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, lung conditions, adverse pregnancy and oral cancer in remote communities and subsequently leads to higher cost impacts for delayed treatment and procedures.
The aim of this project is to build a phone application suitable for daily use to improve oral health awareness.


### How To:

To run the app, navigate to the Dental-Project directory and launch expo with:
```
npx expo start

It is necessary to have both the Expo Go app and an Expo account to launch the app. <br>
